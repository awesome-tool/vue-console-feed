This is the plugin that is almost identical to the [console-feed](https://github.com/samdenty/console-feed) but for Vue. This plugin moves closer to `Console Chrome Devtools` than `console-feed`

[Demo from Stackbliz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vue-console-feed-demo?file=src%2FApp.vue)

** this plugin is still being deployed and is about to release **
